# hello-world
This is where I learn how to use this amazing organization tool
I am a recluse who has been forced to live in society. 
I dream of having a clean and organzed house with features such as
-matching hangers equally spaced in the closets
-an assortment of bonsais that i lovingly prune
-everything having a place so clean up is easy
-well decorated space with ample wall decor 
-clutter free living with only things i like or love in the house
